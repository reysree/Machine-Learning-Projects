For the purposes of this assignment you have to use a logistic regression classifier to predict the sentiment for 18506 reviews for baby products provided in the test file (test.dat). Positive sentiment is represented by a review rating of +1 and Negative Sentiment is represented by a review rating of -1. You may choose any appropriate representation of the text data. We suggest experimenting with bag of words and ngram representations, with and without TF-IDF weighting.

In test.dat you are only provided the reviews but no ground truth rating.

The training data also contains 18506 reviews (in the file train_file.dat). Each row begins with the sentiment score followed by the text corresponding to the review.

For evaluation purposes (and the leaderboard) we will use the accuracy metric, comparing the predictions submitted by you on the test set with the ground truth.

Some things to note:
The public leaderboard shows results for 50% of randomly chosen test instances only. This is a standard practice in data mining challenges to avoid gaming of the system.
The private leaderboard score evaluates all the entries in the test set.
In a 24-hour cycle you are allowed to submit a prediction file a maximum of 10 times. 
Your final ranking will be based on your last submission.
format.dat shows an example file containing 18506 rows alternating with +1 and -1. Your test.dat should be similar to format.dat with the same number of rows i.e., 18506 but of course the sentiment score generated by your developed model.
